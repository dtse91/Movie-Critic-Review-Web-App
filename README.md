# Movie-Critic-Review-Web-App

Visit the website [here](https://tinyurl.com/y8lecjj4).

The purpose of the web application is to predict whether or not a text-based review is positive (i.e. fresh) or negative (i.e. rotten). It is an extension of a [Naive Bayes mini-project](https://github.com/dtse91/Springboard/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Naive%20Bayes/Mini_Project_Naive_Bayes.ipynb) completed previously. The Flask web application is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.
